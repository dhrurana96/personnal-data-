    <h2>Section One What is Ghee?</h2>
    <p>Ghee is typically prepared by simmering butter, which is churned from cream, skimming any impurities from the
      surface, then pouring and retaining the clear liquid fat while discarding the solid residue that has settled to
      the bottom. Spices can be added for flavor. The texture, color, and taste of ghee depend on the quality of the
      butter, the milk used in the process, and the duration of boiling time.

    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>
      Ghee can be made out of many different kinds of milk like cow, sheep, and buffalo milk. Ghee aged 10 to 100 years,
      called Kumbhiighrta, is believed to have medicinal properties.[2] Ghee which is washed for 100 times is called
      Shata Dhauta Ghrita and considered as the oldest Ayurvedic cream.

    <h2>Section Three</h2>
    <p>
      When butter is clarified the milk solids like proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals are removed, except
      for the fat-soluble vitamins. Butter is composed of milk fat (at least 80%), milk solids (about 1%), and water (16
      to 18%).

      To successfully make ghee, the process starts with simmering butter between 221 to 244°F to evaporate the water.
      The temperature is then elevated to above 266 °F so the lactose, casein and whey proteins experience the Maillard
      reaction.

      Browning the milk solids adds wonderfully toasted flavors that become infused with the butter oil. To prevent
      burning of the milk solids, the butter should not reach its smoke point of 350°F. You can use an instant-read
      thermometer for more accuracy to check the temperatures.
